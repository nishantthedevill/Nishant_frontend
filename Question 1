Ques1. - Explain what the simple List component does.
Answer - Using React, the code creates a straightforward List component. WrappedSingleListItem and WrappedListComponent are its two sub-components.
Each individual list item is rendered by WrappedSingleListItem, while WrappedListComponent renders the complete list by mapping over an array of objects and rendering WrappedSingleListItem for each one.
There are four props given to the WrappedSingleListItem component:
1) index: a number designating an item's position in a list.
2) a boolean value indicating if the item is selected
3) onClickHandler: a procedure that responds to the item's click event.
4) text: a string that represents the item's text content
It renders an <li> element with a background color of green if isSelected is true and red if isSelected is false. It also attaches an onClick event handler that calls onClickHandler with the index of the item.
One property is given to the WrappedListComponent:
1)- items: a collection of objects, each of which has a "text" attribute that corresponds to the text of the list item.
Every time the items prop changes, it utilises the useState hook to keep the selected index state consistent and the useEffect hook to reset the selected index. Additionally, it defines a handleClick function that, when a list item is clicked, changes the selected index.
It maps over the items array to render a SingleListItem component for each item, and it also renders an <ul> element with a textAlign style of left. It provides the SingleListItem component with the onClickHandler, text, index, and isSelected properties that it needs.
